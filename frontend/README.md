# Expense Manager frontend
Here is my submission for the expense app

## Requirements:
- **Authentication**: Provide a login form to authenticate users.
- **Registration**: Allow users to register a new account.
- **List Expenses**: Display a list of all expenses.
- **Create Expense**: Provide a form to create a new expense.
- **Update Expense**: Allow users to update an existing expense.
- **Delete Expense**: Enable users to delete an expense.
- **Create Category**: Allow users to create a new category.
- **Logout**: Provide a way for users to logout (Did not attempt as I have near non-existant GO knowledge at this point).
- **JWT Token**: Store the JWT token securely.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors and provide user feedback.

## Authorization:
All endpoints require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

## Recommendations:
The framework used was Angular JS



**Note**: I ran into an issue with standalone component. I ran out of time attempting to refactor my code but I will be reattempting it in my free time


#How to run (after refactoring):
Ensure the backend is running
Open the command line and navigate to the app by doing cd [YOUR REPO FOLDER]\expense-app\frontend\expanse-app-frontend
Run ng serve
